      For the final project, the game is built around the knowledge of grid data structure. Grid data structure will be represented in an example of a 2D-Array structure. By shifting data within the structure, it creates the movement of the snake. The thought of building a simple snake game using JavaScript displayed the creator’s understanding of arrays, loops and true false statement taught from this module.       he creator spent many hours researching for the solution to rip and mash a snake game up. Through researching, she has come across a method using HTML canvas. The instructions are uploaded on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU5YPIvJ24Y).        With that, she has learnt to file the codes and code every element from sketch. The snake game reminded many of the old school Nokia phone game. The creator while learning from the video has research on how array works and has not just applied what was thought but has picked up new methods of JavaScript coding.      Also, with the help of “if else” statements, the creator has learn how to better use conditional statements from various websites such as http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else and http://webcheatsheet.com/javascript/if_else_switch.php.       In conclusion, if given more time and skillsets, the creator would love to improve the game by changing the “fruit” block to an actual food vector image and add in stages of difficulty for players to choose from. Being able to build a simple rip and mash JavaScript snake game is truly an eye-opener to the creator.       Hope this module will be able to reach out to more students! Thank you.
